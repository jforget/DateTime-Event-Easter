In French, we have a phrase: "À Pâques ou à la Trinité" ("On Easter Sunday
or on Trinity Sunday"), to designate a date which may shift for various
reasons. The best example, maybe the origin of this phrase, is the
song "Malbrouk s'en va en guerre" (Marlborough goes to war), based on
Sir John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The song contains the
following verses:

  Il reviendra à Pâques, mironton mironton mirontaine,
  Il reviendra à Pâques
  Ou à la Trinité.
  Ou à la Trinité...

  He'll come back on Easter, tweedledee, tweedledee, tweedledum,
  He'll come back on Easter
  Or on Trinity Sunday
  Or on Trinity Sunday

Another tradition is to pretend that on Good Friday, the bells leave
the church steeples and fly to Rome, where the Pope bless them and
they fly back on Easter Sunday.

Now, about WWII. The American and Commonwealth forces invaded mainland
Italy in September 1943. They made slow progress and they were stuck
on the Gustav line in October 1943.  They executed another amphibious
landing in January 1944 at Anzio and the landing elements were soon
stuck in their beachhead. So the Germans, with their allies and their
puppets, made fun of an invasion that was slower than a snail's pace.

So on Easter, that is, $easter_dt, flyers shaped as bells
were distributed in France by people friendly to the Vichy
regime. These flyers were saying:

  Je reviens de Rome... les Anglais n'y étaient pas encore...
  Alors... à la Trinité ?

  I am back from Rome... The English are not there yet...
  Maybe on Trinity Sunday?

And when did the recon elements of General Clark's army enter Rome? On
$trinity_dt, that is, on Trinity Sunday.
