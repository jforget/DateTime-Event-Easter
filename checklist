See Merijn's checklist:
https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/Checklist.md

Check spaces vs tabs, check encoding, check "use utf8;"

Check version number in:
-- Makefile.PL
-- lib/DateTime/Event/Easter.pm, code ($VERSION and POD for "as_old_set" method)

Check copyright years in:
-- Makefile.PL
-- (2×) lib/DateTime/Event/Easter.pm, head comments and POD (=head2 COPYRIGHT)
-- t/*.t

Check URL, replacing http by https when possible

Kwalitee: compare with the previous version https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/release/JFORGET/DateTime-Event-Easter-1.09

MANIFEST: among others, check that all new test files are mentionned and that removed files no longer appear

Test with all installed perlbrew versions
Test with older DateTime.pm versions (because of the stringification of DT::C::Julian objects)

Coverage: preferably with perlbrew perl-5.28.0

Changes: Type the proper release date for the latest version

Build META.{json,yml} and .tar.gz with perlbrew perl-5.28.0

Check contents of META.{json,yml}:
  version number (2×)
  minimum perl version
  dynamic config 0
  provides (with version number)
  prerequisite: strict and warnings

Check installation on a Virtualbox machine with only DateTime

After release
