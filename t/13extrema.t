# Note that there are a few mistakes in this table. For example, the entry
# for 1758 is a black printed 26 and the entry for 2236 is a black printed 27,
# which translate as 1758-04-26 and 2236-04-27, while actually the easter dates
# for those two years are 1758-03-26 and 2236-03-27 (black ink means April, blue
# ink means March in this table).
