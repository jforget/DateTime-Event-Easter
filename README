DateTime::Event::Easter

The DateTime::Event::Easter module returns Easter events for DateTime
objects. From a given datetime, it can tell you the previous, the
following and the closest Easter event. The 'is' method will tell you if
the given DateTime is an Easter Event.

Easter Events can be Fat Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, Maundy
Thursday, Good Friday, Black Saturday, Easter Sunday, Ascension,
Pentecost and Trinity Sunday. If that's not enough, the module will
also accept an offset so you can get the date for Quasimodo (first
sunday after after Easter Sunday) by passing 7.

For more information, see the POD attached to the Easter.pm file.

INSTALLATION:
=============

Use CPAN, CPANPLUS or CPANMINUS - there's no config in the process that requires you to
do anything strange.

For those of you who like it the manual way, the recipe is the same as normal:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

This module contains no XS code and thus should install anywhere.
